# Open Accessibility Framework (OAF)

The **Open Accessibility Framework** was originally developed in the context
of the European research & development project 
[AEGIS](http://www.aegis-project.eu/), 
which ran from September 2008 till August 2012
and was funded by the European Commission as part of the 
7th Framework Programme (FP7) under project number 224348. 

For an introduction to the Open Accessibility Framework you can refer to the 
following sources: 
* the [section about OAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility#Open_Accessibility_Framework)
in the Wikipedia article 'Computer accessibility';
* the [OAF page on the AEGIS project website](http://www.aegis-project.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=176&Itemid=73).

At the time when the AEGIS project started, Peter Korn, the project's technical
co-ordinator, wrote the following post on his blog:
[Announcing the AEGIS project - a â‚¬12.6m investment in open source accessibility](https://blogs.oracle.com/korn/entry/announcing_the_aegis_project_a) 
(16 October 2008).
