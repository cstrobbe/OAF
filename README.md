# Open Accessibility Framework (OAF)

The **Open Accessibility Framework** was developed in the context
of the European research & development project 
[AEGIS](http://www.aegis-project.eu/), 
which ran from September 2008 till August 2012
and was funded by the European Commission as part of the 
7th Framework Programme (FP7) under 
[project number 224348](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/88209_en.html).

For an introduction to the Open Accessibility Framework you can refer to the 
following sources: 
* the [section about OAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility#Open_Accessibility_Framework)
in the Wikipedia article 'Computer accessibility';
* the [OAF page on the AEGIS project website](http://www.aegis-project.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=176&Itemid=73).

At the time when the AEGIS project started, Peter Korn, the project's technical
co-ordinator, wrote the following post on his blog:
[Announcing the AEGIS project - a â‚¬12.6m investment in open source accessibility](https://blogs.oracle.com/korn/entry/announcing_the_aegis_project_a) 
(16 October 2008).

The page
[AEGIS through OAF](http://www.aegis-project.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=191&Itemid=80)
categorises all AEGIS contributions (mostly open-source tools and software packages)
according to the six components or steps in the Open Accessibility Framework.
